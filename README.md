# Transformers
This project showcases various natural language processing (NLP) applications utilizing popular Hugging Face models and datasets. The applications included are text classification, token classification, question answering, summarization, and translation.

# Introduction
This project leverages state-of-the-art NLP models provided by Hugging Face, such as BERT, ALBERT, T5, DistilBERT, and Roberta, to build a suite of NLP applications. By utilizing these powerful models and rich datasets, this project aims to demonstrate the capabilities of text classification, token classification, question answering, summarization, and translation tasks.

# Models and Datasets
1. This project utilizes the following Hugging Face models and datasets:
* BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
..* ALBERT (A Lite BERT for Self-supervised Learning of Language Representations)
..* T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)
DistilBERT (Distilled BERT)
Roberta (Robustly Optimized BERT Approach)

2.The models are fine-tuned on various datasets, including but not limited to:
